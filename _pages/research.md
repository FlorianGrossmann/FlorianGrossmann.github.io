Coastal Sediment Transport and Morphology
------
Waves generate currents in the nearshore zone. Many of us have experienced them as rip currents or undertow under breaking waves. Apart from their influence on swimmer safety, currents and the wave action itself transport sand (larvae, other sediment, ...) along and away from/towards the coast. I am using laboratory and field experiments to measure with mechanical, acoustic and optical instruments how this happens, and what influences it. Below you can see results from some of our laboratory experiments where we deployed a novel acoustic device ([Hurther et al. 2011](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.coastaleng.2011.01.006)) to measure the sediment transport in the lowest 5 cm above the seabed ([Grossmann et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022JC018998)).

In this way we gain physical understanding on small-scale processes which can be used to understand large-scale phenomena (and replicate them in numerical models). For example, energetic storms can take away many metres of beach in a short amount of time. This, so-called erosion, endangers coastal properties and increases flood risk in the hinderland.
