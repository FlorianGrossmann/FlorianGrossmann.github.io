Coastal Sediment Transport and Morphology
------
Waves generate currents in the nearshore zone. Many of us have experienced them as rip currents or undertow under breaking waves. Apart from their influence on swimmer safety, currents and the wave action itself transport sand (larvae, other sediment, ...) around the coast. I am using laboratory and field experiments to measure with mechanical, acoustic and optical instruments how this happens, and what influences it. Below you can see results from some of our laboratory experiments where we deployed a novel acoustic device ([Hurther et al. 2011](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.coastaleng.2011.01.006)) to measure the sediment transport in the lowest 5 cm above the seabed ([Grossmann et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022JC018998)). The plot below shows measurements of the horizontal velocity in the top panel and the corresponding sediment concentration in the bottom panel. Yellow indicates onshore velocity (large concentration) and blue offshore velocity (low concentration). The black line shows the seabed which erodes and accretes during the repetition period. It is clearly visible that the larger waves in the group lead to larger velocities at the bed and larger erosion, resulting in sediment suspension plumes.

In this way we gain physical understanding on small-scale processes which can be used to understand large-scale phenomena (and replicate them in numerical models). For example, energetic storms can take away many metres of beach in a short amount of time. This, so-called erosion, endangers coastal properties and increases flood risk in the hinderland. Over time the beach tends to recover (see below results of bar onshore migration and berm formation from our [experiments](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coastaleng.2024.104561)) but it is still uncertain how exactly this happens. With our experiments we are well on track to clarify the important role that wave nonlinearity plays in this.

Radar Remote Sensing
------
Apart from the in-situ instrumentation mentioned above, I also use radar remote sensing for a fuller picture. Radar systems emit radio waves which are then reflected back from objects, including the sea surface. By analysing the differences between emitted and reflected radio wave, we can understand something about the properties of the reflecting object (here, ocean waves). While the imaging mechanisms are complex and subject to some uncertainty, radar can give information over large areas. This allows us to understand complex coastal systems such as the ebb tidal delta of the Dutch Ameland inlet, shown below. [Here](https://doi.org/10.18451/978-3-939230-64-9_042) we used the radar to estimate underwater bathymetry (shape of the seabed) and track flow velocities. The shown area measures 15 by 15 kilometres.

Coastal Restoration
------
While the above work is focused on understanding physical processes in the nearshore zone, my [work on coastal restoration](https://rest-coast.eu/) uses the physical understanding to improve coastal management strategies under consideration of climate change. In particular, I am interested which physical conditions make coastal ecosystems, such as salt marshes, thrive, and how to generate those conditions with engineering interventions. Apart from solving the technical side of these issues, it also brought me in contact with local stakeholders, discussing their needs during science outreach activities. Here is a photo of a so-called climatic hut which we use to simulate climate change conditions decades into the future.
