My job allows me to meet many interesting people and learn a lot from them. In this section I have added a few words on some of them. I am always happy to discuss interesting new collaborations, just shoot me an email. This also applies to students looking to be supervised.

Steve Elgar and Britt Raubenheimer
------
Steve and Britt are my primary collaborators at WHOI. I benefit a lot from their sharp thinking, open discussion culture and many years of field experience. I really dig them (here at the FRF in North Carolina)!

José Alsina, David Hurther and Agustín Sánchez-Arcilla.
------
These three are instrumental (pun intended) throughout my academic journey. David introduces me to the mysteries of acoustic signal processing, Agustín makes me aware of the wider context of my research, and José is always ready for an exciting measuring campaign, either in the lab or, as shown below, on Barcelona's beaches.

Sierd de Vries, Marion Tissier, Matthijs Gawehn and Stefan Aarninkhof

* Quick text how I was related to them and maybe dig for a photo
