My job allows me to meet many interesting people and learn a lot from them. In this section I have added a few words on some of them. I am always happy to discuss interesting new collaborations, just shoot me an email. This also applies to students looking to be supervised.

Steve Elgar and Britt Raubenheimer
------
Steve and Britt are my primary collaborators at WHOI. I benefit a lot from their sharp thinking, open discussion culture and many years of field experience. I really dig them (here at the FRF in North Carolina)!

José Alsina, David Hurther and Agustín Sánchez-Arcilla
------
These three are instrumental (pun intended) in my academic journey. David guides me through the mysteries of acoustic signal processing, Agustín makes me aware of the wider context of my research, and José is always ready for a clever measuring campaign, either in the lab or, as shown below, on Barcelona's beaches.

Sierd de Vries, Marion Tissier, Matthijs Gawehn and Stefan Aarninkhof
------
These four sent me off to an exciting start in academia. From sitting in their lectures, to being supervised and now discussing new results in conferences! As part of my research in the Netherlands I also got to visit the flood defenses in Westkapelle.
