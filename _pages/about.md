I am a postdoctoral scholar in the Applied Ocean Physics & Engineering Department of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. I have taken a long route to get here, passing through Aachen, London, Trondheim, Delft, Southampton and Barcelona. My research interests include waves propagating through the nearshore zone, how they transport sediments and other tracers, and how they reshape our coastlines. For more details on individual research projects please see the Research tab.

When not working, I like to enjoy the beauty of natural places - especially from high vantage points.
